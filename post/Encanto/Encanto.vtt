But under the surface, I feel berserk as a tightrope Walker in a three-ring circus.

530
00:34:51.466 --> 00:34:54.636 line:90%
在表面下，就像大力士说
Under the surface was Hercules ever like.

531
00:34:54.803 --> 00:34:56.597 line:90%
「我不想对抗三头犬」

532
00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:58.265 line:90%
在表面下

Who am I if I can't run with the ball?

544
00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:31.548 line:90%
如果向压力屈服，它不肯放手
If I fall to pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go.

如果我动摇
If I falter.

552
00:35:50.067 --> 00:35:51.401 line:90%
在表面下
Under the surface

553
00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:55.447 line:90%
我故作镇定，担心我们受伤害

我能保护它吗？排好骨牌
Can I somehow preserve this? Line up the dominos.

558
00:36:07.292 --> 00:36:09.920 line:90%
一阵轻风吹过，你试图阻止它倒下
A light wind blows you try to stop it topplin'.

559
00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:12.130 line:90%
它开始倾倒，但等等
But on and on it goes but wait.

560
00:36:13.048 --> 00:36:15.050 line:90%
如果我能甩开
If I could shake.

561
00:36:15.717 --> 00:36:19.847 line:90%
期望惊人的重量

562
00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:23.350 line:90%
会不会获得喜悦

563
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.894 line:90%
或放松的空间？

564
00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:30.983 line:90%
或简单的乐趣，不要去测量

不断增长的压力

交给姐姐，千万别怀疑
Give it to your sister and never wonder.

580
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:21.950 line:90%
同样的压力是否会把你拉倒
If the same pressure would have pulled you under.

581
00:37:22.117 --> 00:37:25.120 line:90%
如果没有这般能耐，我算什么？
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?

582
00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:28.332 line:90%
没有裂缝，没有断折

584
00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:42.679 line:90%
我觉得你负担太大了
I think you're carrying way too much...

585
00:37:44.014 --> 00:37:46.183 line:90%
也许我做过头了
Maybe I overdo it.

586

对
Yep.

587

有件事你应该知道

588
00:37:50.938 --> 00:37:53.649 line:90%
昨晚，当你看到裂缝时

我觉得…软弱
I felt... weak.

590

What do you think's hurting the magic?

595

不知道，但有一次我听到大人说
Don't know, but I heard the grown-ups once.

596
00:38:07.371 --> 00:38:09.081 line:90%
在布鲁诺舅舅离开前
Before tío Bruno left...

597
00:38:09.248 --> 00:38:11.917 line:90%
他曾看过一个可怕的幻象
He had, like, some terrible vision about it.

Tío Bruno? What was in his vision?

没人知道，他们始终没找到
No one knows. They never found it.

600
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.550 line:90%
但如果魔法出问题

601
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.633 line:90%

等等，幻象怎么找？到底该找什么？
Wait! How do you find a vision? What am I even looking for?

只要你找到，就会知道
If you find it, you'll know.

606
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.228 line:90%
可是要小心
But be careful.

607
00:38:31.395 --> 00:38:34.356 line:90%
那地方不准靠近是有原因的
That place is off limits for a reason.

608

614
00:39:08.807 --> 00:39:12.060 line:90%
你在这里帮不上忙？
You can't help in here?

615
00:39:14.479 --> 00:39:15.647 line:90%
我没事的

没了，它立马飞走
No. He flew away immediately.

625

我不懂
I don't understand.

873
00:57:28.156 --> 00:57:30.033 line:90%
因为她是他姑姑，她有失忆症

874
00:57:30.033 --> 00:57:30.156 line:90%
Well, because she's his aunt and she has amnesia...

So she can't remember that she's his aunt.

876
00:57:32.244 --> 00:57:34.746 line:90%
这是一种非常禁忌的…
It's like a very forbidden kind of...

877
00:57:34.913 --> 00:57:40.127 line:90%
我不明白你为何离开了又没离开
I don't understand why you left, but didn't leave.

878
00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:45.591 line:90%

883
00:58:15.245 --> 00:58:18.123 line:90%
我的天赋没有帮助家里
My gift wasn't helping the family...

884
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.918 line:90%
但我爱我的家人
But, I love my family, you know?

885
00:58:21.543 --> 00:58:25.255 line:90%
我只是不知道如何…
I just don't know how to...

886
00:58:25.881 --> 00:58:28.342 line:90%
总之你该走了，因为…
Well, anyway, I think you should go, because...

887
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:30.677 line:90%
没什么好理由，如果有，你会说
I don't really have a good reason, but, if I did, you'd be like...

888
00:58:30.677 --> 00:58:30.862 line:90%
I don't really have a good reason, but, if I did, you'd be like...

889
00:58:30.886 --> 00:58:32.596 line:90%
「我该走了，因为这是好理由」
"I should go, because that's a good reason."

890
00:58:32.596 --> 00:58:32.646 line:90%
"I should go, because that's a good reason."

891
00:58:34.598 --> 00:58:35.807 line:90%
为什么我在你的幻象里？
Why was I in your vision?

892
00:58:38.268 --> 00:58:39.645 line:90%
布鲁诺舅舅
Tío Bruno?

893
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.984 line:90%
我只想让家人为我骄傲
I just wanted to make the family proud of me.

894
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:47.778 line:90%
一次就好
Just once.

895
00:58:49.905 --> 00:58:51.740 line:90%
但如果我该停止
But if I should stop...

896
00:58:53.283 --> 00:58:55.619 line:90%
如果我伤害了家人
If I'm hurting my family...

897
00:58:56.495 --> 00:58:58.372 line:90%
尽管告诉我
Just tell me.

898
00:58:59.498 --> 00:59:01.041 line:90%
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you...

899
00:59:01.959 --> 00:59:03.877 line:90%
因为我不知道
Because I don't know.

900
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:09.049 line:90%
你没获得天赋那晚，我看见这个幻象
I had this vision the night that you didn't get your gift.

901
00:59:09.967 --> 00:59:11.552 line:90%
阿嬷很担心魔法
Abuela worried about the magic.

902
00:59:11.718 --> 00:59:15.556 line:90%
她求我预见未来，看它代表什么
So, she begged me to look into the future. See what it meant.

903
00:59:17.057 --> 00:59:20.269 line:90%
我看到魔法陷入危险
And I saw the magic in danger.

904
00:59:21.144 --> 00:59:24.231 line:90%
我们的房子瓦解
Our house breaking.

905
00:59:24.398 --> 00:59:28.235 line:90%
然后…我看到你
And then, and then, and then, I saw you.

906
00:59:28.402 --> 00:59:31.989 line:90%
但这个幻象不同，它会改变
But the vision was different. It would change.

907
00:59:32.155 --> 00:59:35.409 line:90%
而且没有一个答案，没有明确的命运
And there was no one answer. No clear fate.

908
00:59:35.576 --> 00:59:38.537 line:90%
好像你的未来悬而未决
Like your future was undecided.

909
00:59:39.454 --> 00:59:41.874 line:90%
但我知道大家会怎么想
But I knew how it was gonna look. I knew what everyone would think...

910
00:59:41.874 --> 00:59:42.016 line:90%
But I knew how it was gonna look. I knew what everyone would think...

911
00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.043 line:90%
因为我是布鲁诺，大家总往坏处想
Because I'm Bruno and everyone always assumes the worst, so...

912
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.297 line:90%
所以…
So...

913
00:59:49.673 --> 00:59:54.553 line:90%
你离开是为了保护我？
You left to protect me?

914
00:59:55.762 --> 00:59:57.472 line:90%
我不知道情况会怎么发展
I don't know which way it'll go...

915
00:59:58.307 --> 00:59:59.558 line:90%
但我猜…
But my guess...

916
00:59:59.725 --> 01:00:01.977 line:90%
我们家，非凡之地
The family, the encanto...

917
01:00:02.352 --> 01:00:04.313 line:90%
还有奇迹本身的命运
And the fate of the miracle itself...

918
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.357 line:90%
终究会靠你来决定
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.

919
01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:11.111 line:90%
也许我错了
Or maybe I'm wrong.

920
01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:13.780 line:90%
这是个谜，所以我的幻象…
You know, it's a mystery. That's why this vision is...

921
01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:19.203 line:90%
如果还能帮忙，我愿意
Look, if I could help anymore, I would...

922
01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.413 line:90%
但我只知道这么多
But that's all I know.

923
01:00:21.747 --> 01:00:24.625 line:90%
祝你好运，真希望我能看到更多
Good luck. I wish I could've seen more.

924
01:00:25.918 --> 01:00:26.919 line:90%
是啊
Yeah.

925
01:00:30.672 --> 01:00:32.132 line:90%
是啊
Yeah.

926
01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:35.761 line:90%
你希望你能看到更多，那就看更多
You wish you could have seen more, so see more!

927
01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:37.888 line:90%
再来另一个幻象
Have another vision.

928
01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:40.432 line:90%
不，我已经不产生幻象了
No, no. See, I don't do visions anymore.

929
01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:41.808 line:90%
但你可以 -我不愿意
- But you could. - But I won't.

930
01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.979 line:90%
你不能说世界的重担都在你的肩上
You can't say the weight of the world is on your shoulders. The end.

931
01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:49.900 line:90%
如果命运操之在我，那就再来个幻象
If our fate's up to me, me says have another vision.

932
01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.027 line:90%
也许它会指引我
Maybe it'll show me what to do.

933
01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:54.446 line:90%
即使我想，其实我不想
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't, you wrecked my vision cave.

934
01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:54.530 line:90%
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't, you wrecked my vision cave.

935
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.031 line:90%
你也毁了我的幻象洞穴
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't, you wrecked my vision cave.

936
01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:58.700 line:90%
那会是问题，因为我需要开阔大空间
Which is a problem, 'cause I need a big open space.

937
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.452 line:90%
我们去找一个 -哪里？
- We'll find one. - Where?

938
01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:01.620 line:90%
用我的房间
Use my room.

939
01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:05.874 line:90%
老鼠把一切都告诉我了，别吃
The rats told me everything. Don't eat those.

940
01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:14.174 line:90%
我们家需要帮助，你需要离开这里
Our family needs help, and you need to get outta here.

941
01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:33.902 line:90%
你看见幻象时就该告诉我
You should have told me the second you saw the vision.

942
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:35.070 line:90%
想想这个家
Think of the family.

943
01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:37.281 line:90%
我想的是我女儿

944
01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.700 line:90%
佩芭，冷静点
Pepa, calm down.

945
01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:41.118 line:90%
我在努力 -对
- I'm doing my best. - Yes.

946
01:01:41.285 --> 01:01:42.911 line:90%
算你好运，这不是飓风
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.

947
01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:46.540 line:90%
妈妈，你一直对米拉贝儿太严厉
Mamá, you've always been too hard on mirabel.

948
01:01:46.707 --> 01:01:48.125 line:90%
你看看
Look around.

949
01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:51.295 line:90%
我们必须保护家人，非凡之地
We must protect our family, our e ncanto. We cannot lose our home.

950
01:01:51.295 --> 01:01:51.461 line:90%
We must protect our family, our e ncanto. We cannot lose our home.

951
01:01:51.461 --> 01:01:53.338 line:90%
不能失去我们的家
We must protect our family, our e ncanto. We cannot lose our home.

952
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:59.011 line:90%
镇上的人对魔法开始感到焦虑
People in town are becoming anxious about the magic.

953
01:01:59.178 --> 01:02:00.429 line:90%
他们想见你
They want to see you.

954
01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:03.724 line:90%
米拉贝儿出现在幻象中是有原因的
Mirabel was in that vision for a reason.

955
01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:06.059 line:90%
去找她
Find her.

956
01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:13.942 line:90%
我们可能要快点
We might wanna hurry.

957
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:16.320 line:90%
未来是催不得的
You can't hurry the future.

958
01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:20.991 line:90%
要是我给你看到更糟的呢？
What if I show you something worse?

959
01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:23.619 line:90%
如果我看到你不喜欢的事，你会说
If I see something that you don't like, you're gonna be all...

960
01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:25.871 line:90%
布鲁诺让坏事发生，他好诡异
"Bruno makes bad things happen. Oh, he's creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

961
01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:25.954 line:90%
"Bruno makes bad things happen. Oh, he's creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

962
01:02:25.954 --> 01:02:27.664 line:90%
他的幻象害死我的金鱼
"Bruno makes bad things happen. Oh, he's creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

963
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.459 line:90%
我不认为你会让坏事发生
I don't think you make bad things happen.

964
01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:35.422 line:90%
有时家里的怪咖只是名声不好

965
01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:37.424 line:90%

I can do this. I can do this, I can do this, I can do this.

968
01:03:21.218 --> 01:03:22.594 line:90%
（布鲁诺）

969
01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.722 line:90%
你可能得抓紧
You might wanna hang on.

970
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.551 line:90%
还是一样，我得停下来
It's just the same thing. I gotta stop!

971
01:04:02.718 --> 01:04:07.264 line:90%
不，我得知道怎么发展，一定有答案
No. I need to know which way it goes. There's gotta be an answer.

972
01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:08.599 line:90%
我们没看到的关键
Something we're not seeing!

973
01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:10.350 line:90%
你看到的跟我一样
You're looking at the same thing that I am.

974
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:10.485 line:90%
You're looking at the same thing that I am.

975
01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:12.060 line:90%
如果还有别的… -那里
- If there was something else... - There!

976
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.162 line:90%
- If there was something else... - There!

977
01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:13.604 line:90%
在那边
Over there!

978
01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:15.272 line:90%
蝴蝶
Butterfly!

979
01:04:15.272 --> 01:04:15.396 line:90%
Butterfly!

980
01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:16.940 line:90%
跟着蝴蝶走
Follow the butterfly!

981
01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.447 line:90%
那是哪里？
Where is that?

982
01:04:23.864 --> 01:04:25.782 line:90%
全都乱了
It's all out of order.

983
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:30.621 line:90%
是那根蜡烛，越来越亮了
It's the candle. The candle's getting brighter!

984
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:33.290 line:90%
我想你会帮助那根蜡烛 -怎么帮？
- I think you're gonna help the candle! - How?

985
01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:35.334 line:90%
有人跟你在一起
There's someone with you.

986
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.836 line:90%
你和她打架 -什么？
- And you fight her! - What?

987
01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:39.588 line:90%
不，那是拥抱吗？
Wait, no, no. Is that a hug?

988
01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:40.756 line:90%
我是在打架还是拥抱？
Am I fighting or hugging?

989
01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:43.717 line:90%
拥抱…
An embrace. An embrace!

990
01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:45.886 line:90%
为了使蜡烛发亮，你必须拥抱她
To make the candle bright you have to embrace her.

991
01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.346 line:90%
拥抱谁？
Embrace who?

992
01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:48.931 line:90%
快看到了
Almost there.

993
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:50.891 line:90%
是谁？-快看到了
- Who is it? - Almost there.

994
01:04:51.808 --> 01:04:52.809 line:90%
有了

995
01:04:54.561 --> 01:04:56.104 line:90%
伊莎贝拉？
Isabela?

996
01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.529 line:90%
你姐？太好了
Your sister? That's great!

997
01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:06.782 line:90%
每次都这样
Every time.

998
01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:11.078 line:90%
拥抱伊莎贝拉怎么会有用？
Why would embracing Isabela do anything?

999
01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:13.247 line:90%
不知道，我们家有个奇迹
I don't know. Our family got a miracle. How do you help a family miracle?

1000
01:05:13.247 --> 01:05:13.330 line:90%
I don't know. Our family got a miracle. How do you help a family miracle?

如何帮助家庭奇迹？

1002
01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:14.125 line:90%
I don't know. Our family got a miracle. How do you help a family miracle?

1003
01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:15.249 line:90%
拥抱一个姐妹
You hug a sister.

1004
01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:18.460 line:90%
米拉贝儿…
Mirabel? Mirabel?

1005
01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:21.463 line:90%
米拉贝儿
Mirabel?

1006
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.590 line:90%
我觉得我们快没时间了
Well, I think we're running out of time here.

1007
01:05:23.757 --> 01:05:25.133 line:90%
这是行不通的
It's not gonna work.

1008
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.303 line:90%
她根本不会拥抱我，她恨我
She won't hug me ever, okay? She hates me!

1009
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.931 line:90%
你有没有听说我毁了她的求婚过程
Also, I don't know if you heard, I ruined her proposal!

1010
01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:33.600 line:90%
而且，她超烦人的 -米拉贝儿
- Plus, p.S., she is just annoying. - Mirabel?

1011
01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.477 line:90%
当然是伊莎贝拉 -米拉贝儿
- Of course it's Isabela! - Mirabel?

1012
01:05:35.644 --> 01:05:36.979 line:90%
她对我到底有什么意见？
What's her problem with me anyway?

1013
01:05:36.979 --> 01:05:37.004 line:90%
What's her problem with me anyway?

1014
01:05:37.145 --> 01:05:38.397 line:90%
她让玫瑰从…
She's the one with roses coming out of her...

1015
01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:38.540 line:90%
She's the one with roses coming out of her...

1016
01:05:38.564 --> 01:05:39.731 line:90%
米拉贝儿
Mirabel!

1017
01:05:39.898 --> 01:05:41.400 line:90%
对不起…
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1018
01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:43.402 line:90%
你搞错重点了
You see, you're missing the point.

1019
01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:46.071 line:90%
我们家的命运不是由她决定
The fate of the family, it's not up to her.

1020
01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:47.614 line:90%
而是取决于你
It's up to you.

1021
01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:51.493 line:90%
你正是这个家需要的
You're exactly what this family needs.

1022
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.371 line:90%
你必须明白这点
You just have to see it.

1023
01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:57.165 line:90%
自己去，我先离开
By yourself, after I leave.

1024
01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.043 line:90%
什么，你不一起来吗？
What, you're not coming?

1025
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:04.006 line:90%
那是你的幻象，不是我的
It was your vision, mirabel. Not mine.

1026
01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:05.591 line:90%
你怕阿嬷会见到你
You're afraid abuela will see you.

1027
01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:07.718 line:90%
对，也是
Yep. I mean, yes, that too.

1028
01:06:09.928 --> 01:06:13.432 line:90%
等你挽救了奇迹之后再来找我
Hey, after you save the miracle, come visit.

1029
01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:18.854 line:90%
等我挽救奇迹之后，我要带你回家
After I save the miracle, I'm bringing you home.

1030
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.815 line:90%
敲敲敲…求好运
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.

1031
01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:21.900 line:90%
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.

1032
01:06:34.328 --> 01:06:38.248 line:90%
你可以的，只要挽救奇迹
You got this. Just gonna save the miracle.

1033
01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.667 line:90%
用一个拥抱
With a hug.

1034
01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:44.671 line:90%
伊莎？嘿
Isa? Hey.

1035
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.425 line:90%
我知道我们有点问题
I know we've had our issues...

1036
01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:54.389 line:90%
但我准备当个更好的妹妹了
But I'm ready to be a better sister... To you.

1037
01:06:54.806 --> 01:06:57.100 line:90%
所以我们应该拥抱一下

1170
01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:46.653 line:90%
米拉贝儿，房子要垮了

- Everyone okay? - Antonio, don't cry, papito.

1182
01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:01.728 line:90%
我想保护它却不行 -非凡之地毁了
How is this possible? The encanto's broken.

1183
01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:03.146 line:90%

01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:28.482 line:90%
我并不想伤害大家
I didn't want to hurt us.

1201
01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:31.652 line:90%
我只想…
I just wanted...

1202
01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:35.072 line:90%
跟原来的自己不一样
To be something I'm not.

1203
01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:53.632 line:90%
我始终无法回来这里
I've never been able to come back here.

1204
01:17:56.385 --> 01:18:02.683 line:90%
这条河是我们奇迹降临的地方
This river is where we were given our miracle.

1205
01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:07.813 line:90%
也就是佩德罗阿公…
Where abuelo Pedro...

1206
01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:14.570 line:90%
我以为我们的生活会不一样
I thought we would have a different life.

1207
01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:19.366 line:90%
我以为我会改头换面
I thought I would be a different woman.

1208
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:49.141 line:90%
我获得一个奇迹
I was given a miracle.

1209
01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.604 line:90%
第二次机会
A second chance.

1210
01:20:57.649 --> 01:21:00.652 line:90%
我好害怕失去它
And I was so afraid to lose it...

1211
01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:08.368 line:90%
忘了我们奇迹的初衷
That I lost sight of who our miracle was for.

1212
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:15.667 line:90%
我好抱歉
And I am so sorry.

1213
01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:21.131 line:90%
你从来没伤害过我们家，米拉贝儿
You never hurt our family, mirabel.

1214
01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:24.009 line:90%
我们家庭破碎
We are broken...

1215
01:21:28.305 --> 01:21:30.265 line:90%
是因为我
Because of me.

1216
01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.114 line:90%
阿嬷
Abuela.

1217
01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:49.826 line:90%
我终于明白了
I can finally see.

1218
01:21:54.164 --> 01:21:56.959 line:90%
你失去了你的家
You lost your home.

1219
01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:01.296 line:90%
失去了一切
Lost everything.

1220
01:22:03.131 --> 01:22:05.801 line:90%
你吃了那么多苦
You suffered so much...

1221
01:22:05.968 --> 01:22:07.803 line:90%
孤单无助
All alone...

1222
01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:11.598 line:90%
那种情况才不会再发生
So it would never happen again.

1223
01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:17.020 line:90%
我们是因为你才得救
We were saved because of you.

1224
01:22:17.896 --> 01:22:21.775 line:90%
我们是因为你才获得奇迹
We were given a miracle, because of you.

1225
01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:26.613 line:90%
我们是因为你才成为一个家
We are a family, because of you.

1226
01:22:27.406 --> 01:22:30.534 line:90%
无论碰上任何困难
And nothing could ever be broken

1227
01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:34.496 line:90%
我们都能一起解决
that we can't fix... together.

1228
01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:42.462 line:90%
我向我的佩德罗求助
I asked my Pedro for help.

1229
01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:46.175 line:90%
米拉贝儿
Mirabel.

1230
01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.470 line:90%
结果他派你来给我
He sent me you.

1231
01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:22.044 line:90%
不是她做的
She didn't do this!

1232
01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:25.047 line:90%
不是她做的
She didn't do this!

1233
01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.592 line:90%
我给了她一个幻象
I gave her a vision!

1234
01:23:30.469 --> 01:23:31.470 line:90%
是我
It was me!

1235
01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:34.014 line:90%
我说「去吧」，她就…
I was, like, "go!" And she was, like...

1236
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.058 line:90%
她只是想帮忙
She only wanted to help.

1237
01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:40.270 line:90%
我不管你怎么看我，如果你太顽固…
I don't care what you think of me, but if you're too stubborn to...

1238
01:23:42.064 --> 01:23:43.315 line:90%
Brunito.

1239
01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:48.904 line:90%
我好像漏掉了什么重点
I feel like I missed something important.

1240
01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:50.989 line:90%
走吧
Come on.

1241
01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:01.333 line:90%
现在是怎样？我们要去哪？
What's happening? Where are we going?

1242
01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:04.127 line:90%
回家
Home.

1243
01:24:10.717 --> 01:24:12.344 line:90%
是她，我发现她了
It's her! I found her!

1244
01:24:12.511 --> 01:24:13.887 line:90%
是我发现她的
I found her!

1245
01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:16.098 line:90%
她回来了…
She's back! She's back, she's back!

1246
01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.402 line:90%
米拉贝儿
Mirabel!

1247
01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:32.656 line:90%
米拉贝儿
Mirabel!

1248
01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:34.950 line:90%
妈妈
Mamá.

1249
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:35.074 line:90%
Mamá.

1250
01:24:36.034 --> 01:24:37.452 line:90%
亲爱的，我担心死了
Mi amor, I was so worried.

1251
01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:39.162 line:90%
我们找不到你
We couldn't find you.

1252
01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.124 line:90%
到处都是蜜蜂
There were bees everywhere.

1253
01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:45.294 line:90%
我不会有事的
I'll be okay.

1254
01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:48.797 line:90%
要有房子才行
Not if we don't have a house.

1255
01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:51.466 line:90%
怎样？我们没房子啊，不能说吗？
What? We don't have a house. I can't say we don't have a house?

1256
01:24:51.633 --> 01:24:53.051 line:90%
那是什么？不是房子
What is that? Not a house.

1257
01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:05.564 line:90%
看看这个家，我们需要新的基础
Look at this home we need a new foundation.

1258
01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:09.860 line:90%
看似绝望，但我们会撑过去
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine.

1259
01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:14.406 line:90%
看看这个家，闪闪发亮的一群人
Look at this family a glowing constellation.

1260
01:25:14.573 --> 01:25:19.369 line:90%
宛如星星，每个人都想闪耀
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine.

1261
01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:25.125 line:90%
但星星不会发光，而是燃烧
But the stars don't shine, they burn.

1262
01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:29.004 line:90%
群星也会变换
And the constellations shift.

1263
01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:34.301 line:90%
你该体认到
I think it's time you learn.

1264
01:25:34.468 --> 01:25:37.721 line:90%
你的天赋无法代表你
You're more than just your gift.

1265
01:25:37.888 --> 01:25:41.350 line:90%
抱歉我一直逼得太紧
And I'm sorry I held on too tight.

1266
01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:46.146 line:90%
我好怕也失去你们
Just so afraid I'd lose you too.

1267
01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:49.942 line:90%
奇迹不是你拥有的魔法
The miracle is not some magic that you've got.

1268
01:25:50.567 --> 01:25:51.818 line:90%
奇迹就是你
The miracle is you.

1269
01:25:51.985 --> 01:25:54.655 line:90%
不是某种天赋，就是你
Not some gift just you.

1270
01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.156 line:90%
奇迹就是你
The miracle is you.

1271
01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:58.534 line:90%
你们所有人…
All of you all of you.

1272
01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:02.538 line:90%
好吧，我们要谈布鲁诺吗？
Okay so we gonna talk about Bruno?

1273
01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:03.914 line:90%
那是布鲁诺？
That's Bruno?

1274
01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:07.209 line:90%
是啊，布鲁诺有很多事能说
Yeah there's a lot to say about Bruno

1275
01:26:07.376 --> 01:26:09.294 line:90%
我先开始，佩芭，对你的婚礼很抱歉
I'll start, okay pepa, I'm sorry about your wedding.

1276
01:26:09.294 --> 01:26:09.376 line:90%
I'll start, okay pepa, I'm sorry about your wedding.

1277
01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:10.462 line:90%
我不是故意要恶整
Didn't mean to be upsetting.

1278
01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:10.541 line:90%
Didn't mean to be upsetting.

1279
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:12.464 line:90%
那不是预言，我能看到你在冒汗
That wasn't a prophecy I could just see you were sweating.

1280
01:26:12.464 --> 01:26:12.607 line:90%
That wasn't a prophecy I could just see you were sweating.

1281
01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:14.508 line:90%
我要你知道，你哥很爱你
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so.

1282
01:26:14.508 --> 01:26:14.631 line:90%
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so.

1283
01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:16.385 line:90%
让它进，让它出，让它下雨下雪
Let it in, let it out let it rain, let it snow.

1284
01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:16.475 line:90%
Let it in, let it out let it rain, let it snow.

1285
01:26:16.552 --> 01:26:17.386 line:90%
让它过去吧
Let it go.

1286
01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:18.846 line:90%
我也这么说，哥
That's what I'm always saying, bro

1287
01:26:18.846 --> 01:26:18.913 line:90%
That's what I'm always saying, bro

1288
01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:20.639 line:90%
我有很多事要道歉
I got a lot of apologies I got to say.

1289
01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:22.975 line:90%
我们很高兴你回来，懂吗？
Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?

1290
01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:24.935 line:90%
进入光明 -行程只有一夜
- Come into the light. - That trip was only a night.

1291
01:26:24.935 --> 01:26:25.021 line:90%
- Come into the light. - That trip was only a night.

1292
01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:27.271 line:90%
无论如何，我们都会找到方向
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way.

1293
01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:29.565 line:90%
我知道他没离开，每天都听到他
Yo, I knew he never left I heard him every day.

1294
01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:34.695 line:90%
那是什么声音？
