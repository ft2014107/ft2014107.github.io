00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:13.949 line:90%
There is?

307
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.621 line:90%
It's an old magic, rarely practiced.

308
00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:23.917 line:90%
In theory, I could do it,

309
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:26.295 line:90%
but not in my present state.

310
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:30.841 line:90%
I would need you
to do a few things for me.

311
00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:31.884 line:90%
What?

312
00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:35.095 line:90%
Anything. Name it, and I'll do it.

313
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:40.059 line:90%
And this would have to remain
between you and me.

314
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.643 line:90%
No one else can know.

315
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.272 line:90%
Whatever. Just tell me.

316
00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.523 line:90%
Well,

317
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:51.528 line:90%
first, I could really use a drink.

318
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.864 line:90%
Some troll mead would be nice.

319
00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:57.826 line:90%
Hilda! Hilda!

320
00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.913 line:90%
It's that troll. She won't give up.

321
00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:02.456 line:90%
You should go to her.

322
00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:03.624 line:90%
[troll] Hilda!

323
00:18:03.707 --> 00:18:04.750 line:90%
Are you crazy?

324
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:06.460 line:90%
She's the one that did this to me.

325
00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:09.213 line:90%
You may find this hard to understand,

326
00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:13.133 line:90%
but there was a kindness in her magic.

327
00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:16.553 line:90%
She won't allow any harm to come to you.

328
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:22.434 line:90%
In fact, she will take care of you
as though you were her own child.

329
00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.353 line:90%
Yeah, well, I'm definitely not.

330
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.814 line:90%
[Trundle] Nevertheless…

331
00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.524 line:90%
Hilda!

332
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:34.113 line:90%
[Trundle] …as long as you're out here,
that troll is your mother.

333
00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:38.742 line:90%
And a mother's love
should not be taken for granted.

334
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.253 line:90%
I should still be looking for her.
We should never have come home.

335
00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:51.380 line:90%
No, you need rest.

336
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:54.633 line:90%
Besides, it's no good
if you get yourself eaten.

337
00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:58.011 line:90%
She really is quite resourceful,
that daughter of yours.

338
00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:01.056 line:90%
I'm sure she's made some arrangements.

339
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.143 line:90%
-She shouldn't have to make-- Ow!
-Baba, baba, baba!

340
00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:05.769 line:90%
Please, can you just…

[crying]

345
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.200 line:90%
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to shout, I--

346
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:21.326 line:90%
[crying]

347
00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.455 line:90%
Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.
I've got you.

348
00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:26.415 line:90%
Shh.

349
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.417 line:90%
-Come on.
-Baba.

[sniffles]

351
00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:41.889 line:90%
I still don't really understand why.
Why you did it.

352
00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.183 line:90%
My daughter is a gentle soul.

353
00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.810 line:90%
You've seen what it can be like out here.

354
00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:49.897 line:90%
Turning to stone. The bells.

355
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.859 line:90%
This is no place for her
at the best of times,

356
00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:55.611 line:90%
and there's trouble brewing.

357

[all grumble and growl]

358
00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:00.908 line:90%
Even so,
you can't just swap people like that.

359
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:02.326 line:90%
It's kidnapping!

[ethereal tones ringing]

361
00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:08.832 line:90%
What is that?

362
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.795 line:90%
It's like a sound. But more of a feeling.

363
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:16.924 line:90%
I can't hear it, but I know it's there.

364
00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.425 line:90%
We all feel it.

365
00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:21.803 line:90%
I don't know what it is,
but it's always been there.

366
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:24.056 line:90%
Calling us towards the city.

367
00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:28.936 line:90%
Have you ever wondered why we stay here
among these particular mountains

368
00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:31.813 line:90%
when we are so clearly unwelcome?

369
00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.690 line:90%
I always thought it was pretty obvious.

370
00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.984 line:90%
You were here long before Trolberg was.

371
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:42.991 line:90%
I don't think I ever realized
there were this many of you out here.

372
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:46.245 line:90%
The calling has become stronger lately.

373
00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:51.667 line:90%
It's bringing more and more of us
out of the mountains each night.

374
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.169 line:90%
The humans have noticed.

375
00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:56.463 line:90%
I'm sure they imagine

376
00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:59.591 line:90%
there's some kind of plan
to storm the city.

377
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:02.052 line:90%
There isn't, though, right?

378
00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:04.888 line:90%
Of course not, but that's not the point.

379
00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.641 line:90%
There are some that want to lash out,

380
00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:10.519 line:90%
to answer the call the only way they can.

381

But, could they really do anything?
With the wall, and those bells?

384
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:26.660 line:90%
[sighs] Maybe not.

385
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:31.540 line:90%
It'll be sunrise soon.
We should rest. Big day tomorrow.

386
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.250 line:90%
What are we doing?

387
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:35.585 line:90%
Showing you how to be a troll.

[Erik] Huh!

392
00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:57.274 line:90%
Perhaps we could erect
some kind of large net,

393
00:21:57.357 --> 00:21:59.985 line:90%
to catch anything
thrown over and prevent--

394
00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:04.156 line:90%
No, no, no, no. That doesn't capture
the imagination enough.

395
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.327 line:90%
They need something to look towards,
not practical solutions.

But, sir, given the--

-What's this?
-That is a gun, sir.

398
00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.374 line:90%
It utilizes a compact version

399
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.836 line:90%
of the technology
from the troll-buster cannon, but--

400
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:20.380 line:90%
Yes! This could be just the thing.

401
00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:23.842 line:90%
But sir, that is a one-of-a-kind,
untested prototype.

402
00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:25.802 line:90%
I am not sure it even works.

403
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.598 line:90%
Come, Gerda. The people await!

You see this?

456
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.235 line:90%
This is what we're up against!

457
00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:32.614 line:90%
Cowards.
They turn to stone rather than face me.

458

And the rest slink off
and disappear once the sun is up.

459
00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:40.121 line:90%
It strikes me
that they are keeping to themselves, sir.

460
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.083 line:90%
It strikes me that
they are denying us victory.

It appears to be a pigeon, sir.

-Sir?
-Take them by surprise.

468
00:26:02.477 --> 00:26:04.271 line:90%
Secure the advantage.

469
00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:07.399 line:90%
But nobody has ever found a way
into troll country.

470
00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:10.527 line:90%
Nobody yet.

471
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.029 line:90%
But if we can do this, Deputy Gerda,

472
00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:17.409 line:90%
my name will go down
in the annals of Trolberg history.

Come, we have plans to make.

Silence the bells!

Silence the bells?
Exactly whose side are you on?

481
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:48.106 line:90%
We're on the side
of peace and communication.

482
00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:50.859 line:90%
The enemies of misinformation and fear.

483
00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:54.988 line:90%
Really? Well, I'd love to hear
what your teachers have to say about that.

484
00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:59.367 line:90%
Their teacher is very proud of them
and would ask you to move along.

[man] Hmm!

David, what's this about?

00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:16.551 line:90%
It's my mum.
She's only gone and volunteered

490
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:19.679 line:90%
to be one of Ahlberg's
emergency bell-ringers.

491
00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:22.891 line:90%
And I'm guessing
she wouldn't approve of all this.

You think you can help me
get her back home?

502
00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:42.535 line:90%
I'll explain on the way.

503
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:45.205 line:90%
[David] Hilda's a troll?

504
00:27:45.288 --> 00:27:47.457 line:90%
Yes, it's not ideal.

505

Oh, boy!

506
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:50.960 line:90%
The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

507
00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:54.964 line:90%
Well, you're a witch. Is there a spell
or something that could turn her back?

508
00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:56.549 line:90%
There has to be.

509
00:27:56.633 --> 00:27:58.843 line:90%
Come on, let's ask Kaisa.

-What did I do with my jumper?

Ugh!

513
00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:15.902 line:90%
[Kaisa] Body swapping. I think
this is the book you're looking for.

514
00:28:15.985 --> 00:28:17.987 line:90%
-[gasps] Thanks.
-Wait.

515
00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:20.198 line:90%
-Whose bodies are we swapping?
-Hilda's!

516
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:22.867 line:90%
She's been swapped
with a troll changeling child,

517
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.828 line:90%
and we need to change her back.

518
00:28:24.911 --> 00:28:28.248 line:90%
Ah. That's not going to work, I'm afraid.

519
00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:30.166 line:90%
What? Why?

520
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.837 line:90%
Troll magic. It's just, uh…
Works differently.

521
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.715 line:90%
You can't counter
a troll spell with witch magic.

522
00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:38.216 line:90%
They don't combine.

-At all.
-But--

524
00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:43.221 line:90%
On top of that, witches do not like
to get involved in troll affairs.

525
00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:45.765 line:90%
It's kind of a protocol thing

526
00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:49.102 line:90%
that the council
would love to explain to you in detail.

But this is Hilda we're talking about.

528

You know her.

529
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:57.235 line:90%
I do. And so I know
she'll find her own way out of this.

530
00:28:57.318 --> 00:28:58.945 line:90%
You seriously can't help?

-To have breakfast.

543

It's okay

Uh…

551

A drink for you.

Oh, I love this stuff. What is it?

555
00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:16.648 line:90%
That's troll mead.

556

Powerful stuff.

557
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.153 line:90%
Just a sip will keep

-I won't be long.
-Okay.

[troll 1] Hmm. Too much troll mead.

561

[troll 2] Say, who's got it anyway?

562

[Trundle] Ah! That's the stuff.

563

I feel like I could pull
the horns off a forest giant.

Is that a good thing?

It's something.

Next?

Yes, next.

569
00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:57.355 line:90%
What's the next thing I need to do
for you to turn me back?

Oh!

No time to chat?

Uh…

No, no, you're in a hurry.

574
00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:09.325 line:90%
Who'd want to be a troll
longer than they have to be?

575
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:10.660 line:90%
I'm sorry, I didn't--

576
00:31:10.743 --> 00:31:13.955 line:90%
The next thing I would ask of you

577
00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:19.043 line:90%
is that you remove
those dreadful bells from my front door.

578
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.463 line:90%
What? How am I supposed to do that?

579
00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:26.217 line:90%
If I knew, I would have done it myself.

580

Humph.

581
00:31:29.095 --> 00:31:31.931 line:90%
Tell me. Why are there so many bells here?

582
00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:34.809 line:90%
Someone obviously
didn't want you to leave.

583
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:39.772 line:90%
They were worried enough about you
to put a bell on your nose.

584
00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:42.525 line:90%
What do you think they make of me?

585
00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:44.444 line:90%
Mmm.

586
00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:47.113 line:90%
If it's too much trouble…

587

No.

588
00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.700 line:90%
I'll figure it out.

I'm talking about. What idea?

646

To lead an army of trolls
